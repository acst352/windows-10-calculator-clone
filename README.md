# windows-calculator-clone
A calculator based on https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Vanilla-JavaScript-Calculator
which I want it to look like the Microsoft Windows 10 original Calculator but lacking the exact same functionallity. 

I like the minimalist designs of Microsoft Windows 10 so to start practicing I thought this would be easy to do. ðŸ˜€
